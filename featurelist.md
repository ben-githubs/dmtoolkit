# Planned

## Encounters

- Save current encounter across page reloads as temporary encounter
- Delete encounters
- Be able to see encounter XP and monsters without opening the encounter (perhaps a `?` button with a popup?)

## Proper Monsters API

- Speaks for itself

## Statblocks

- fix remaining `{@xx yy}` mappings
- render speeds with notes properly (see will-o-wisp for example)
- include cool picture in top corner like in 5e.tools
- render tagged monster type properly
