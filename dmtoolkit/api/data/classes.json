The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include {@deity Gond}, {@deity Reorx|Dragonlance}, {@deity Onatar|Eberron}, {@deity Moradin|Nonhuman}, {@deity Hephaestus|Greek}, and {@deity Goibhniu|Celtic}."
