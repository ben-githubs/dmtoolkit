The `cmd` module offers some useful CLI utility for developing the app. The primary purpose so far is to provide an automated pipeline to download raw JSON data from `5e.tools` and convert it into a more structured format.

The data from `5e.tools` is not very self-consistent; sometimes fields are an array, sometimes a scalar, and sometimes they have 2 fields and they omit one depending on whether it's an array or scalar (ex: `entries` is an array of entries, but `entry` is used if there's only one entry, but not always...). This is realy hard to write templates for when rendering the statblock, as it requires a lot of logic to determine what fields to use, what types of data we're working with, etc. Having this automated pipeline means we can abstract the templates to work with an idealized model, and all the ugle conversion code sits here, away from the main code base.
